# Install the daemon

Snaps are app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross-platform and dependency-free. 

The snap daemon, known as *snapd*, is the background service that manages and maintains your snaps. It needs to be  running before a snap can be installed.

Fortunately, the snap daemon is pre-installed and running on many distributions by default, and it's easy to install on most other distributions.

See [Troubleshooting](/how-to-guides/fix-common-issues/index) for help resolving installation issues.
