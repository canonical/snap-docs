# Install the daemon

Snaps are app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross-platform and dependency-free. 

The snap daemon, known as *snapd*, is the background service that manages and maintains your snaps. It needs to be  running before a snap can be installed.

Fortunately, the snap daemon is pre-installed and running on many distributions by default, and it's easy to install on most other distributions.

## Snap pre-installed

The snap daemon (snapd) is pre-installed and ready to go on the following:

| | |
|--|--|
| [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/) | [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) |
[Solus](https://getsol.us/) | [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 18.04 and above |
 | Most [Ubuntu flavours](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DerivativeTeam/Derivatives#Official_Ubuntu_Flavors) | [Zorin OS](https://zorinos.com/) |

## Without snap

For distributions without the snap daemon pre-installed, use the links on the left for installation instructions.

See [Troubleshooting](/snap-how-to-guides/fix-common-issues/index) for help resolving installation issues.
