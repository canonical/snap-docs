# Install snap on Parrot Security OS

If you're running [Parrot Security OS 4.1](https://www.parrotsec.org/) and above, you don't need to do anything. Snap is already installed and ready to go.

On older versions of Parrot OS, snap can be installed from the command line (and the *Synaptic Package Manager*). Launch the terminal from the top toolbar and enter the following:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snapd
```
