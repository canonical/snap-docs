# Snap-Tutorials

This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what snap is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing your favourite applications, taking a data snapshot, removing snaps or reinstalling the snap daemon (snapd).

## Get started

Snap is installed by default on Ubuntu and many other Linux distributions. Our _Features tour_ is an ideal way to get started.
