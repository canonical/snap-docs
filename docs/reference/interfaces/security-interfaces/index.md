# Security interfaces

Security [Interfaces](/snap-explanation/interfaces/all-about-interfaces) are interfaces that control access to data that may either secure your system, or data that may be considered personal, including gpg-keys, firewall access, and encryption.

See [Supported interfaces](/snap-reference/operations/interfaces/index) for a complete list of interfaces.
