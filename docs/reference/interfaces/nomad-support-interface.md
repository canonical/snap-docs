# The nomad-support interface

The `nomad-support` interface provides permissions to enable [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) to access [cpuset](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html) CPU and memory management, alongside Nomad-specific capabilities such as the NVIDIA plugin support, slice functions, and Nomad running as a service.

See [Interface management](/) and [Supported interfaces](/interfaces/index) for further details on how interfaces are used.
