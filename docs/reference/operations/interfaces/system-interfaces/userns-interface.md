# userns-interface

The `userns` interface permits a snap to create new user [namespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html). This is a system-level interface, and is not designed to be used with higher level snap applications.

```{tip}

See [Interface management](/) and [Supported interfaces](/interfaces/index) for further details on how interfaces are used.
