Snaps can be easily installed and managed from the [command line](/getting-started/3876).

But if you use a desktop environment,  snaps can be more readily discovered, installed and managed from the [Snap Store desktop  app](https://snapcraft.io/snap-store).

The Snap Store app is installed with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo snap install snap-store
```
>â“˜ See [Installing snapd](/) if you don't already have snapd installed.

Snap Store can now be launched from your desktop's default launcher.
