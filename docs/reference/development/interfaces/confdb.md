# confdb

The `confdb` interface enables snaps to access to specific  [confdb](/interfaces/confdb) views.

There are two fields that together identify the view being accessed: `account` and `view`. There is also an optional `role` field which may only take the value of "custodian", if the snap is a custodian for the confdb-schema being accessed.

See the [Confdb configuration mechanism](/interfaces/confdb) for implementation details, and [Configure snaps with confdb](/) to use confdb with your own snaps.

**Auto-connect**: no, but plugs are auto-connected if the confdb's account is the same as the snap's publisher.
