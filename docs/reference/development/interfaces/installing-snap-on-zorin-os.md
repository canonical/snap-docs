If you're running [Zorin 12.3](https://zorinos.com/) and above, you don't need to do anything. Snap is already installed and ready to go.

On older versions of Zorin OS, snap can be installed from the command line. Launch the terminal from the Utilities menu and enter the following:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snapd
```
