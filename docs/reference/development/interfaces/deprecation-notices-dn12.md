The `snapcraft registered` and `snapcraft list-registered` keywords, used to list snap names registered or shared with your account, have been replaced by `snapcraft list`.

_list-registered_ was simply an alias for _registered_.

_introduced in snapcraft 4.0_

See [Deprecation notices](/interfaces/deprecation-notices)  for further announcements.
