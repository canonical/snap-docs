This is the old table of contents page. It has been replaced with [Snap Documentation](/).

The new page includes a table that maps each topic in the documentation to the final URL seen from [docs.snapcraft.io](https://docs.snapcraft.io/), allowing us to fine-tune the URL without changing the topic title.

Welcome to the home of snap, snapd, and snapcraft documentation.

>  â“˜  Snaps are app packages for desktop, cloud and IoT that are easy to install, secure, cross-platform and dependency-free.

- **snap** is both the command line interface and the application package format
- **snapd** is the background service that manages and maintains your snaps 
- **snapcraft** is the command and the framework used to build your own snaps
- **[Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store)** provides a place to upload your snaps, and for users to browse and install

**Discovering snap:**
