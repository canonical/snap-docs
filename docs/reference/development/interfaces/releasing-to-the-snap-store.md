# releasing-to-the-snap-store

Once you have a snap that works under [strict or classic confinement](/interfaces/choosing-a-security-model), you're ready to publish the snap in the Snap Store where it can be showcased to millions.

This is a simple, three-step process:
1. [Create your developer account](/interfaces/creating-your-developer-account)
2. [Register your app's name](/interfaces/registering-your-app-name)
3. [Release your app](/)
